Russia's intelligence agency has been on a mission to generate "sustained mayhem on British and European streets", the head of MI5 has said. In a rare public speech, Ken McCallum warned that the UK was facing the most "complex and interconnected" threat it has ever seen. MI5 has also responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since 2022, the director general said. He said the complex mix of terror-related threats and threats from nation states meant that MI5 had "one hell of a job on its hands". A total of 43 late-stage plots to commit "mass murder" in the UK have been foiled since 2017, he said, involving firearms and explosives. Mr McCallum said the security service's counter-terrorism work still mostly involved Islamic extremism, followed by "extreme right-wing terrorism". But he added there was a "dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies" MI5 had to deal with. "The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats. We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war," he said. In a briefing at MI5’s counter-terrorism operations centre in London, Mr McCallum said in the past year, the number of state-threat investigations by MI5 had increased by 48%. Mr McCallum accused Russia of "arson, sabotage and more dangerous actions" in the UK. He said more than 750 Russian diplomats had been expelled from Europe since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying "a great majority of them" were spies. This affected the Russian intelligence services' capability, McCallum explained, and added that diplomatic visas had been denied to those Britain and allies considered Russian spies. Russian state actors turned to proxies, such as private intelligence operatives, to do "their dirty work", but this impacted the professionalism of their operations and made them easier to disrupt. He also told the briefing that MI5 and police had responded to 20 Iran-backed plots since 2022, which presented “potentially lethal threats to British citizens and UK residents".
The US presidential election is just weeks away and one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention from both parties: young voters. But it’s economic woes – from inflation to housing – that could drive them to the polls. It’s Isabella Morris’s first presidential election, and the 21-year-old mum from Rosenberg, Texas, said she’s listening closely to what both candidates have to say. Recently married with a two-year-old, Isabella works part-time to supplement her husband’s full-time income. She stays at home with her child while her family rents a small one-bedroom apartment. The plan seemed solid—two incomes, no mortgage, or daycare costs—but it’s not enough. “Our debts are paid off, but we can’t afford any mistakes. We have no savings, nothing. One job used to be enough to live on, even at a minimum wage. Now it feels like we’re barely scraping by," she said.
Dorothy Masasa happily walks down a dirt road on a sunny afternoon, her baby securely strapped on her back. Just six months ago the 39-year-old, originally from southern Malawi's Thyolo district, was in Kenya for life-saving radiotherapy. Malawi has only recently received its first such machines, so other women with cancer may no longer have to travel abroad for treatment. “I was registered as an emergency case after doctors discovered I had cervical cancer while 13 weeks pregnant. They told me these two things don’t go together,” the mother of three tells the BBC. She says the doctors in Malawi told her that she could have an operation to remove the cancer but this would terminate the pregnancy, or she could have chemotherapy but this would risk the baby being born with a disability. She opted for chemotherapy until the baby was born via Caesarean section - without any disability. Her uterus was removed in the same operation. Before the diagnosis, Ms Masasa experienced cramping in her lower abdomen, bleeding and a foul-smelling vaginal discharge that just wouldn’t go away. At first doctors thought it was a sexually transmitted infection. But despite the chemotherapy and the operation, she still needed further treatment to cure the cancer - treatment which wasn't available in Malawi until earlier this year. She joined a group of 30 women who were taken to a Nairobi hospital in Kenya by the aid agency Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to undergo radiotherapy to kill the cancerous cells. This was the first time she had travelled on a plane so she was quite worried and also reluctant to leave her newborn baby behind. "But because I was going there for treatment, I encouraged myself that I should indeed go and get treatment and that I will come back home healthy and happy." When the BBC visited her at the hospital, Ms Masasa was still frail from the effects of the treatment, having lost weight and her hair. She is one of 77 patients who was airlifted from Malawi to Kenya for cervical cancer treatment since 2022. Sixty years after gaining independence from the UK, Malawi only installed its first radiotherapy machine, at the privately owned International Blantyre Cancer Centre, in March this year, marking a huge step in the country’s healthcare system.
A Dutch museum had to pick artwork out of the bin after a member of staff thought that the display, which consisted of two empty beer cans, was leftover rubbish. All The Good Times We Spent Together by French artist Alexandre Lavet shows two dented beer cans on the floor. They were exhibited inside the museum’s lift as if left behind by construction workers. However, a closer look "reveals that these dented cans were meticulously hand-painted with acrylics", the LAM museum in Lisse said. But a lift technician thought the art was simply the leftovers of lazy visitors and threw them in the bin. Once a curator spotted that the artwork was missing, staff were tasked with searching for it, the museum said on its website. Eventually it was discovered in a bin bag and "miraculously, both cans were found intact", it said. The cans were cleaned and placed at the museum's entrance. Despite the mishap, the museum says it "bears no ill will towards the lift technician who made the mistake", who was covering for someone who is "well acquainted with the building and its exhibits". “The theme of our collection is food and consumption,” said Sietske van Zanten, the museum’s director. “Our art encourages visitors to see everyday objects in a new light. By displaying artworks in unexpected places, we amplify this experience and keep visitors on their toes.”
Netherlands legend Johan Neeskens has died at the age of 73, the Dutch football federation has confirmed. The former midfielder was part of the Ajax and Netherlands teams credited with creating "total football" in the 1970s. "With Johan Neeskens, the Dutch and international football world loses a legend," the KNVB federation said in a statement. Neeskens was capped 49 times for the Dutch and was part of the teams that finished runners up at the 1974 and 1978 World Cups. At Ajax he helped them win the European Cup three times and their domestic league twice. Neeskens also spent five seasons at Spanish giants Barcelona, winning the Copa del Rey and European Cup Winners' Cup with them. "His name is forever linked to European successes with clubs like Ajax and Barcelona and two World Cup finals for the Dutch national team," the KNVB added. "With his characteristic tackles, sublime insights and iconic penalties, [he] will forever remain one of the most prominent and beloved players to ever play for our country." After retiring as a player in 1991, Neeskens coached several clubs and was also an assistant coach with the Dutch national team from 1995 to 2000.
This chapter discusses the general concepts of gain spectrum, amplifier bandwidth, and operating characteristics of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs). The nonlinear and dispersive effects are included using the Maxwell-Bloch formalism. The Ginzburg-Landau Equation is used to discuss a variety of nonlinear effects in fiber amplifiers. Amplifier characteristics, such as the operating wavelength and the gain bandwidth, are determined by dopants rather than by the fiber, which plays the role of a host medium. Fiber amplifiers amplify incident light through stimulated emission, the same mechanism used by lasers. Indeed, an optical amplifier is just a laser without feedback. The gain of EDFAs depends on a large number of parameters such as erbiumion concentration, amplifier length, core radius, and pump power. Much insight can be gained by using a simple model that neglects amplified spontaneous emission and excited-state absorption. Amplification of short optical pulses can be studied by solving the Ginzburg- Landau equation numerically.
An important application of nonlinear fiber optics consists of compressing optical pulses. This chapter provides an overview of the theories and experimental issues related to the study of pulse-compression techniques. There are two kinds of compressors commonly used for pulse compression. The grating-fiber compressors use a fiber with normal group-velocity dispersion (GVD) followed by a grating pair. The soliton-effect compressors make use of higher-order solitons forming when self-phase modulation (SPM) and anomalous GVD occur simultaneously. The use of fiber gratings for pulse compression and the technique of chirped-pulse amplification is also discussed in this chapter. The basic idea behind optical pulse compression is borrowed from chirp radar, where chirped pulses at microwave frequencies are compressed by passing them through a dispersive delay line. The basic idea behind chirped-pulse amplification consists of chirping and stretching the pulse before it is amplified. The use of chirped-pulse amplification has resulted in the advent of tabletop terawatt laser systems in which mode-locked pulses emitted from solid-state lasers are amplified to obtain picosecond, or even femtosecond, pulses with terawatt peak powers.
This chapter focuses on soliton communication systems with emphasis on the physics and design of such systems. This chapter begins with the basic; concepts related to solitons. It discusses how solitons can be used for designing lightwave systems, loss-managed solitons, and Noise and timing-jitter issues. The chapter concludes with an overview of the use of solitons for wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) lightwave systems with emphasis on timing jitter induced by interchannel collisions. Solitons result from a balance between group-velocity dispersion (GVD) and self-phase modulation (SPM), both of which can limit the performance of fiber-optic communication systems. The use of optical amplifiers affects the evolution of solitons considerably. The reason is that amplifiers, although needed to restore the soliton energy, also add noise originating from amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). The timing jitter issue has attracted considerable attention because of its practical importance. Interaction between neighboring solitons also affects the timing jitter. A WDM soliton system transmits over the same fiber several soliton bit streams, distinguishable through their different carrier frequencies. Sliding-frequency filters can reduce timing jitter in WDM systems. The technique of synchronous modulation can also be applied to WDM systems for controlling timing jitter.
Mono and hybrid nanofluids have gained great interest recently in many engineering fields due to their excellent thermophysical, transport, mechanical, and electrical properties, which can be easily used in refrigeration, heat pump, and air-conditioning systems by many roles for performance improvement. This chapter focuses on the applications of mono and hybrid nanofluids in different roles in refrigeration, air-conditioning, and heat pump systems to enhance the performance, such as: (i) nanoparticle-dispersed secondary fluids (as a secondary refrigerant in the evaporator, as a coolant in the condenser, and as a heating fluid in the generator of heat-driven system), (ii) nanoparticle-dispersed refrigerants (called as nanorefrigerants), (iii) nanoparticle-dispersed lubricants (called as nanolubricants), (iv) nanoparticle-dispersed absorbents (called as nanoabsorbents), (v) nanoparticle-dispersed phase-change materials (called as nano-PCMs) in the cold storage system, and (vi) nanoparticle-dispersed fluids in nonconventional systems. Finally, various challenges and future research and development scopes are discussed as well.
Unsteady Falkner–Skan stream of nanofluid within the sight of magnetophoresis is thought about over a moving wedge. The fundamental point of the work is to attempt influences of the magnetic field and magnetophoresis on the stream. Additionally, the entropy produced in the process and the Bejan number of the flow system have been estimated mathematically and broken down through diagrams and charts. The constitutive stream model previously changed over into an arrangement of ordinary differential conditions utilizing similarity transformations. Utilizing mathematical strategies, the ordinary differential equations are solved. The stream characters and entropy generation are arranged through appropriate diagrams and tables to stage the convincing results in the light. Here, the authors have found out that the induced magnetic field can decelerate the process of entropy production in the system, which implies that the decay in the performance of the drift system can be proscribed by the adaptable, induced magnetic field.

Goodreads Choice AwardNominee for Best Historical Fiction (2023) In 1972, when workers in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, were digging the foundations for a new housing development, the last thing they expected to uncover was a human skeleton. Who the skeleton was and how it got buried there were just two of the long-held secrets that had been kept for decades by the residents of Chicken Hill, the dilapidated neighborhood where immigrant Jews and African Americans lived side by side, sharing ambitions and sorrows. Chicken Hill was where Moshe and Chona Ludlow lived when Chona ran the Heaven & Earth Grocery Store, which served the neighborhood's quirky collection of blacks and European immigrants, helped by her husband, Moshe, a Romanian-born theater owner who integrated the town's first dance hall. When the state came looking for a deaf black child, claiming that the boy needed to be institutionalized, Chicken Hill's residents—roused by Chona's kindess and the courage of a local black worker named Nate Timblin—banded together to keep the boy safe. As the novel unfolds, it becomes clear how much the people of Chicken Hill have to struggle to survive at the margins of white Christian America and how damaging bigotry, hypocrisy, and deceit can be to a community. When the truth is revealed about the skeleton, the boy, and the part the town’s establishment played in both, McBride shows that it is love and community—heaven and earth—that ultimately sustain us.
